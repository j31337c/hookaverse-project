## Hookaverse

** Hookaverse is a broader ecosystem or frontend for HookFi built with Next.js

Hookaverse Developer Environment:

- **Foundry**: Used for developing and testing smart contracts (e.g. the OnsidedUSDCHook)
- **Next.js**: Manages the frontend, integration with HookFi's API or contracts for token issuance and pool creation.
- **Base Network**: The target blockchain (as HookFi/Flaunch operates on Base Eth)

Objective: Create a one-sided token issuance and token USDC pool with a custom Uniswap v4 hook, restricting swaps to LPs.
